# datafusion

# Note: the following line has been removed to discourage dependency on the
# `datafusion` (aka `datafusion-core`) crate: the `datafusion` crate is an
# aggregation crate that pulls in and re-exports symbols from the other, finer
# grained datafusion-xxx crates, while adding some APIs for the datafusion
# execution runtime. However, it builds much slower than the individual crates.
# Therefore, only a select few crates (specifically, those that have to interact
# with the datafusion runtime) should depend on the `datafusion` crate, for all
# other crates, you should prefer using the individual datafusion-xxx crates
# directly whenever possible.
